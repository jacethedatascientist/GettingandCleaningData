## **Dataset Files**

   * README.txt
   * features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
   * features.txt: List of all features.
   * activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
   * train/X_train.txt: Training set.
   * train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
   * test/X_test.txt: Test set.

## **Activities**

   * WALKING
   * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   * SITTING
   * STANDING
   * LAYING

## **The run_analysis.R script does the following**

   1. Merges the training and test set in 1 data set.
      * use rbind() to merge each table in train and test. ( combine each x, y, and sub to create x_all,y_all, and sub_all)
      * use cbind() to merge tbe x_all,y_all, and sub_all to create train_test
   2. Extracted mean and standard deviation measurements from the merged data set.
      * use grepl on column names of train test to extract "std" and "mean"
      * overwrite train_test
   3. Renamed the activities and the features to more descriptive names.
      * rename the columns using gsub() 4)Created the final data set as tidydata.txt with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
      * group_by() to group Activity and Subject
      * get mean using summarize_all()
      * create new file using write.table()
